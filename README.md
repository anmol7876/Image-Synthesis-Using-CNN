# Image-Synthesis-Using-CNN
This project explores the fascinating intersection of machine learning and artistic creativity through the implementation of an image synthesis technique known as art style transfer. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the project aims to transform the artistic style of one image onto another, effectively creating a new image that merges the content of the original image with the style of a chosen artwork.

Key Features:

1. Content Image: The primary image whose content is to be preserved. This can be any photograph or image that the user wishes to transform.

2. Style Image: The artwork or image that serves as the source of the artistic style. This could be a famous painting, a digital art piece, or any image with a distinct style.

3. Output Image: The synthesized image that combines the content of the content image with the stylistic features of the style image.
